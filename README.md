# Laughing Matter Blog and CMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and deploy your "Laughing Matter" blog with its integrated Content Management System (CMS) on Netlify.

## What's Included

This package contains a complete, minimalist blog with:

1. **Clean, Text-Focused Design**: A minimalist blog design that emphasizes readability
2. **Two Main Sections**: "Interesting Stuff" and "Some Books" as requested
3. **Integrated CMS**: A simple admin interface to manage your content
4. **Netlify-Ready Configuration**: Everything needed for seamless deployment

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
