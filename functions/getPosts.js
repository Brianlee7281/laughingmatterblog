From the 50 different types of toothpaste at the grocery store to the endless scroll of content on streaming platforms, choice has become both a blessing and a burden.\n\nPsychologist Barry Schwartz coined the term \"paradox of choice\" to describe how having more options can actually lead to increased anxiety, decision fatigue, and ultimately, less satisfaction with our choices. This counterintuitive idea challenges the conventional wisdom that more choice equals more freedom and happiness."
